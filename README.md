# Dotfiles

My dotfiles! Based off of Parth's dotfiles, used to keep work, desktop, and laptop workflow's the same, and modified to use my zshrc, vimrc, and i3config.

## Programs included in the config

+ i3 (i3-gaps)
+ vim
+ bash
+ tmux
+ zsh
+ Oh my zsh

### Todo:

+ Update deploy script that installs i3 & i3-gaps if not installed. 


### If vim-instant-markdown isn't working:

Make sure that instant-markdown-d is installed using
    npm -g install instant-markdown-d
    
    
pandoc -V geometry:margin=.5in -V fontsize:12pt -s -o diversifyincome.pdf diversifyincome.md
